        "\n",
        "Truncation still present: Even with different prompt engineering techniques and varying k values, the issue of truncated answers, particularly for the sepsis protocol question, persists. This further reinforces the idea that the truncation is likely due to the model's inherent limitations on sequence length or the RetrievalQA chain's processing rather than the retrieval process or prompting.\n",
        "Prompt Engineering Impact: While prompt engineering didn't solve the truncation, it did seem to slightly influence the style and focus of the answers. For example, the \"Give a brief yet complete medical answer for\" prompt for the sepsis question provided a more summarized list of interventions compared to the other prompts. However, the core information extracted remained largely the same.\n",
        "Consistency in other answers: For questions other than the sepsis protocol, the answers remained relatively consistent across different k values and prompts, suggesting that the retrieval is effective for these queries and the model is able to utilize the retrieved context to provide relevant information.\n",
        "Appendicitis surgery still missing: The answers to the appendicitis question consistently provided symptoms but did not include information about the surgical procedure, regardless of the prompt or k value. This continues to suggest an issue with either the retrieval of that specific information or the model's ability to synthesize it into the answer.\n",
        "In conclusion, while prompt engineering can subtly influence the output style, it doesn't seem to address the fundamental limitation of truncated answers with the current model and setup. The missing information about appendicitis surgery also indicates potential areas for improvement in either retrieval or the model's ability to fully utilize the retrieved context."
